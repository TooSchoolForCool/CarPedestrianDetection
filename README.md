# Car Pedestrian Detection



This project is a simple course project focus on Car & Pedestrian Detection. I did not go further in this project, just tried to train some simple SVM model implemented by OpenCV, and yes... it does not have a very good performance.



Anyway, if you want to learn how to use SVM in OpenCV with python, this project may be a good sample.



Actually, I started another project of car/vehicle & pedestrian detection, which is way better than this one. Please go and check it out [HERE](https://github.com/TooSchoolForCool/Pedestrian-Vehicle-Detection).
